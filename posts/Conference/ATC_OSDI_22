## KEY NOTE: Surprize-Inspired Networking

- what will be surplus?
  - Edge capacity
  - High resolution sensors
- how will future apps be different?
  - they will be proactive
    - E2C (Edge-to-Cloud)

## [ATC] ZNSwap: un-Block your Swap

- Motivation
  - Swap on traditional SSDs
    - certain performance anomalies
- Flash SSDs
- ZNSwap : new sw33ap subsystem for ZNS

## [OSDI] BlockFlex

- HarvestVMs: Promising for Improved Resource Utilizaion
- Storage harvesting is challenging
  - Insufficient virtualizaition support
  - Data security concern
  - Storage performance interference
- Software-defined flash

## [OSDI] MemLiner2

- Observations
  - App and GC are just temporally unaligned
  - Changing object access order in GC is possible

## [OSDI] ListDB

- DRAM+PM Hybrid index/KV-store
- Challenges to avoid write stalls
  - DRAM-PM latency gap
  - WA
  - PM is more sensitive to NUMA effects than DRAM
- NUMA-aware braided skiplist

## [OSDI] Odinfs

- Design goal
  - Maximize PM performance
  - Maintain…
- Key
  - Decouple PM access from app threads
  - Fixed number of delegation threads limit concurrent access
  - Delagation threads always perform localized PM access
  - Utilize aggregated bandwidth

## [ATC] AddrMiner

# 7/12

## [Keynote] Truthworthy Open Source: The Consequences of Success

- Security problems
- free, but ‘as is’

### Curation: Adding a layer of accountability

- Two roles :Distribution vs Accountability
  - Distribution: maximize availability of AS IS sw
  - Accountablility: supported, more secure versions, perhaps for a fee
- Open source with “Support”
  - Focus on fixing vulnerabilites, not just findingtthem

## [OSDI] Trinity

- mobile emulator is more than a traditional VM
- Graphics processing is the key in mobile emulator
- Prev work
  - RPC
  - Async driver commands
  - Breaking virtualization
- Goal
  - mobile emulator with high efficiency and compatibility
  -
- Graphics projection
- Elasic flow control
- Adaptive data teleporting

## [OSDI] ORION

- Optimize serverless DAG execution

    -

## [OSDI] XRP: In-Kernel Storage Functions with eBPF

- Kernel SW is becomeing the bottleneck for storage
- Bypass kernel to eliminate overhead
- Kernel bypass
  - pros
    - No storage stack overhead
  - cons
- XRP: A framework for in-kernel storage functions

## [OSDI] TriCache

-

## [ATC] Memory Harvesting in Multi-GPU Systems with Hierarchical Unified Virtual Memory

## [OSDI] Verifying the DaisyNFS concurrent and crash-safe filesystem

- Challenges in veritying FS
  - Crashes
  - Concurrency
- DaisyFS: FS code implemented with transactions

## [OSDI] Fast, Automated Inference of Inductive Invariants for Verifying Distributed Protocols

- When accessing app(VM client) data, hypervisor have full previlege.
- But hypervisor is vurnelable

## [ATC] IPLFS

## [ATC[ Vigil-KV

## [ATC] Pacman

- Problem
  - High-latency index traversal
  - Extra persistence work
  - Excessive small random accesses
- Design
  - Traverse index with shortcut
  - Redesign comapction pipeline
  - Separate hot-cold data
  - Reduce excessive PM accesses

# 7/13

- Challenge
  - Complex data exchange / structures
  - Low-level Kernel/C idioms
  - Concurrency primitives
- Goals
  - Isolate the complete driver
  - Identify
    - shared/private data
    - . . .

## [ATC] FlatFS: Flatten Hierarchical FS Namespace on NVMs

- Motivation
  - Expensive namespace tree traversal
    - Traversing tree causes…
      - indirect memory access
      - random memory access

## [ATC] StRAID

## [ATC] Vinter

- Crash consistency
  - goal: recover semantically correct state
