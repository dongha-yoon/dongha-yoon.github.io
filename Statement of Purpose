My objective for attending CMMRS program is widening my insight on Computer Science. This program is my first chance to participate international research ground..
As you can see my resume, I am a beginner on research area. So I want to communicate others to find my way.
My overall academic performance is not outstanding. But performance on the major subjects are good.
Especially, I got A+ grade on the fundamental computer system related subjects(Computer Architecture, System Programming, Operating Systems)

I have been belonging to NECSST lab (UNIST, professor Sam H. Noh) since January, 2021.
Until now, I have participated weekly meeting and presented course contents and paper summary.
It was good experience to learn how to analyze research papers and how to describe what I studied to others

My research interest is focused on Computer system software. I'm conducting on a research project about Memory Tiering with persistent memory.
As I know, persistent memory is one of the research trends in computer science. I'm sure this program will be meaningful for me. Thank you.
